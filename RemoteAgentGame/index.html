	<p> Remote Agent is a quirky and colorful side-scroller about an agent whose remote monitoring station has been attacked by an unknown source. 
	Left with no means of communication, Rooster is forced to leave his station and seek help.<br>
	<br>
	As his journey begins, however, it becomes clear that whatever source destroyed Rooster's station has also unleashed a strange, new chaos across the land.
