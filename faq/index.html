  <h3>1. What did you do before you became a game developer?</h3>
 <br>
  <h4>I'm a painter/illustrator so I was making artwork and schmoozing with gallery owners. I felt unproductive so I learned to code and put my creative skills to the test.</h4>
  <br>
  <h3>2. Are you a girl?
    <h4> No, I'm a lady. </h4>
    <br>
    <h3>3. How did you come up with the idea for Remote Agent?</h3>
    <h4> I've thought about a game like this since I was a kid and I had the basic concept down, but it wasn't until I read a story about weird radio messages coming through some old lady's phone that I had an epiphany and it snowballed from there.</h4>
