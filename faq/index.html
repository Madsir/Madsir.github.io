  <h4> What did you do before you became a game developer?</h4>
 <br>
  <p>I'm a painter/illustrator so I was making artwork and schmoozing with gallery owners.
    I felt unproductive so I learned to code and put my creative skills to the test.</p>
  <br>
    <h4> How did you come up with the idea for Remote Agent?</h4>
    <p>Heard a story about an old lady picking up NATO signals on her landline. I don't know how it turned into this but it did.</p>
  <br>
   <h4> How did you come up with the idea for Chinchilla Dance Party?</h4>
  <p>I have dance party breaks with my chinchilla (I dance, he popcorns) while I'm programming and one of those days was full of math and he was super excited so I made a game out of it.</p>
