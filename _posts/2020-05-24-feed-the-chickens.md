Current stage of development: 

All levels are built, including bonus levels. Toilet Noise is working on the soundtrack, making some dank retro tunes to fit the mysterious and creepy settings in the game.<br>
I'm messing around with post processing features and cutscenes. There aren't many and they aren't long so it's fun to experiment. I built my own storytelling and theaterclip assets and they've both worked wonderfully from the start. Stay  healthy, stay tuned. - Bird
