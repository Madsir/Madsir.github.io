title: "Madsir Studio presents Remote Agent"

Remote Agent is something I've been dreaming up since I was a young SNES-playing girl. A game that mixed together all of my favorite mechanics and elements into one weird package, with a story never heard before.

It took me some years but finally I can say that I've created a game worthy of my childhood dreams. I mean, it's still got bugs and needs some more work and polishing before I release it, but little me would be proud.
Stay tuned for more updates and backstory about how I brought this game to life.
