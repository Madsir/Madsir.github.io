My first game is about to be released onto the Google Play Store

After a month of production, a week of trial and failure implimenting ads, a risky update to the newest version of Unity, and another week of testing and getting everything in order, it's finally done. 
It's not my first game I've ever made but it's the first one I've ever released, and that makes me finally feel like a legitimate game developer. I finally have something to point to when people ask what games I've made.
Stay tuned, chickens.
