UTTERER LANGUAGES
<br><br>
Utterer Languages is a scriptable object which stores information and guides the components connected to it.<br>
This asset creates a menu of available languages. You can use this menu to add languages to the asset's Languages In Use list. Utterer Languages stores the ISO, native name, and English name of each language you add to the Languages in Use list.<br>
<br><br>
Creating & Setting Up a Languages Asset<br><br>

Step 1: Create a Languages Asset<br>
<br>
In the Project Window, right-click  a folder in Assets, hover over the Create menu, and select Utterer Languages.<br>
A new language asset will be created. Rename the asset as you please.<br>
A demo asset can be found here: Assets/Utterer/Demo/Demo Assets/Utterer Languages Demo.asset<br>

<br><br><br>
Step 2: Add to the Languages In Use List<br><br>

Select the asset. In its inspector, click the 'Choose Languages' menu. Select the languages you want to add to the Languages In Use list.<br>
To remove a language from the list, click it again.<br>

<br><br><br>
Step 3: Set the Current Language (In Editor)<br><br>

In the Languages In Use list, check the box of the language you want to set as the current language in use.<br>
If the application is playing and no language is selected, then the first language in the list will become the current language in use.<br>
<br><br>
Utterer Languages uses a script called Language Chooser for syncing dropdown components with the Languages In Use list.<br>
While the Languages In Use list displays the English names of each language, Language Chooser will display the native name of each language in its native script if available, else the name will display in Roman script.<br>
<br><br>
Language Chooser allows the user to choose a language at runtime. The Utterer Languages asset will save any changes made, guiding its related components to reflect those changes.<br>

<br><br><br>

METHOD 1 : Use one of the Language Chooser Prefabs<br><br>

Step 1: Add a Language Chooser prefab to the scene.<br><br>

Navigate to one of the prefabs listed below and drag it into the hierarchy as a child of a Canvas.<br>
Legacy Dropdown: Assets/Utterer/Prefabs/Languages/Language Chooser<br>
TextMeshPro Dropdown: Assets/Utterer/Prefabs/TMPro Variants/Languages/Language Chooser TMP<br>

<br><br><br>
Step 2: Add your Utterer Languages asset to the prefab.<br><br>


Select the prefab you added. In its Language Chooser component, add your Utterer Languages asset using the object field.<br>
Language Chooser will fill out its options with your asset's information<br>

<br><br><br>

METHOD 2 : Create your own Dropdown<br><br>

Step 1: Add LanguageChooser.cs to a game object with a dropdown component.<br><br>

On the object with the dropdown component, click Add component, select the Utterer menu, and then select Language Chooser.<br>
Language Chooser will fill out the Dropdown's Options with its Languages List
<br><br>

Step 2: Add Language Chooser's ChooseLanguage function to the dropdown's On Value Changed(int32)<br><br>


Drag the object with the dropdown component into its own OnValueChanged (int32) event object field.<br>

<br>
In the On Value Changed function menu, hover over LanguageChooser and then click the ChooseLanguage() function.<br>
The ChooseLanguage() function detects which language is selected and triggers the Utterer Languages asset to update the device to the current locale, as well as guiding its relative components to reflect the changes made<br>

<br><br>
Using Utterer Languages with Text, Image, and Audio Source Components<br><br><br>

Method 1: Use the Utterer Languages asset's Options for Current Scene<br><br>


Step 1: Choose one of the two selection settings.
<br><br>
Click the Auto toggle and hover over it to reveal its tooltip.<br>
The eligible components mentioned in the tooltip are determined by which localization option is chosen. The Auto setting will not target any Utterer components<br>
<br><br>

Click the Self toggle and hover over it to reveal its tooltip.<br>
The Self setting will check all selected objects for an eligible component (based on which localization option you choose) and add the relevant script to the object<br>

<br><br>
Step 2: Choose one of the localization options.<br><br>

Texts Option<br>
Click the Texts button to localize Text/TMPro components in the scene.<br>
Adds an UttererTexts script to all eligible gameobjects in the open scene depending on the selection setting<br>
UttererTexts Script: For every language in the Languages In Use list, a Text Area will be created in the Utterer Texts tool. Each Text Area will be named after its respective language<br><br><br>


Images Option<br>
Click the Images button to localize Image components in the scene.<br>
Adds an UttererImages script to all eligible gameobjects in the open scene depending on the selection setting<br>
Utterer Images script: For every language in the Languages In Use list, a Sprite field will appear in the Utterer Images tool. Each field will be named after its respective language<br><br><br>


Audio Sources Option.<br>
Click the Audio Sources button to localize Audio Sources in the scene.<br>
Adds an UttererAudio script to all eligible gameobjects in the open scene depending on the selection setting<br>
Utter Audio script: For every language in the Languages In Use list, an AudioClip field will appear in the Utterer Audio tool. Each field will be named after its respective language<br><br><br>


Method 2: Manually add a script to a game object
<br><br><br>

Step 1: Add an Utterer Texts, Images, or Audio script to a game object.<br><br>

In the game object's inspector, click Add Component, select the Utterer menu, and then select the relevant Utterer script.<br>
For example: On a game object with a Text component, the relevant Utterer script would be the Utterer Texts script<br>

<br><br><br>

Utterer Languages with Dialogue & Captions

<br><br>
Both the Dialogue Tool and the Captions Tool have a blue, square Localize button in their top menu bar. Next to the Localize button is a blue Languages menu. If there is no Utterer Languages asset connected with the tool, the Languages menu will be inaccessible<br><br>

Step 1: Connect the tool with your Languages asset.<br><br>

Click the Localize button and select your Languages Asset using the object field.<br>
The Localize button brings up a new window with an object field. Drag your Utterer Languages asset here, or find it using the object field.<br>
The tool will display the content for the first language listed in the Languages menu. The tool will only display content for one language at a time. Select a language from the menu to edit its content
<br><br><br>

Step 2: Use the tool's Languages menu to choose which language is being shown and edited in the window.<br><br>

Click the Languages menu and select a language.<br>
The tool will switch the contents of the window with the contents for that language. All edits will be saved automatically<br>



<br><br><br>









Utterer Dialogue System<br><br><br>

The Utterer Dialogue System creates and controls linear and dynamic dialogue sequences<br><br>


Setting Up A Dialogue System<br><br>

Step 1: Add a Dialogue System prefab to the scene.<br><br>

Drag a prefab into the hierarchy.<br>
The prefab will automatically break its prefab status and become a regular game object in the hierarchy. This is to prevent accidental overrides on the prefab<br><br>

Legacy Text System (Requires Canvas)<br>
Location: Assets/Utterer/Prefabs/Dialogue/Dialogue Legacy UI<br>
TextMeshProUGUI System (Requires Canvas)<br>
Location: Assets/Utterer/Prefabs/TMPro Variants/Dialogue/Dialogue TMP UI<br>
TextMeshPro 3d Dialogue + Speaker<br>
Location: Assets/Utterer/Prefabs/TMPro Variants/Dialogue/Dialogue + Speaker TMP Object<br>
TextMeshPro 3d Object<br>
Location: Assets/Utterer/Prefabs/TMPro Variants/Dialogue/Dialogue TMP Object<br><br>

Please note: Dialogue TMPro variants do not contain options for text outlines so outlines will have to be set manually on the TextMeshPro/UGUI material.<br>
Dialogue TMP Objects are currently incompatible with Responses.<br>
<br><br><br>


Step 2: Choose your settings.<br><br>

Select the Dialogue System object in the hierarchy. In the inspector, click the Settings foldout in the Utterer Dialogue System component.<br><br><br>

Content Fade<br><br>
Content Fade is a bool which when set to true causes any enabled content (icon, speaker, dialogue, button) to fade in and out at the beginning and end of each dialogue in the sequence<br><br><br>

Style Fade<br><br>
Style Fade is a bool which when set to true causes any enabled style (background, outline, scrollbar) to fade in and out at the beginning and end of each dialogue in the sequence<br><br><br>

Paint On<br><br>
Paint on is a bool which when set to true causes the system to add one letter or word at a time, depending on the type setting. Creates a bool to control word vs letter, and a float field for you to control the rate at which the letter/word appears<br><br><br>

Freeze Scene<br><br>
Freeze scene is a bool which when set true changes the time scale to zero at the beginning of the dialogue sequence and then resets time scale to its original value at the end of the sequence<br><br><br>

Positions<br><br>
If using a TextMeshPro Object, this setting allows for the positioning of each dialogue in the sequence<br><br><br>



Step 3: Choose your options.<br><br>

Click the Options foldout in the Utterer Dialogue System component.<br>
<br>
Outline - If true, shows the outline of the system and creates style fields for its image and color<br>
Outline Full - If true, the outline expands to contains all responses<br>
Background - If true, shows the background of the system and creates style fields for the its image and color<br><br>

Speaker - If true, shows the system's speaker and creates style fields for its font and color<br>
Icon - If true, shows the icon if one is available in the dialogue sequence<br>
Scrollbar - If true, shows a scrollbar for the dialogue and creates style fields for its back and handle images and colors<br>
Button - If true, shows the system's advance button and creates style fields for its image and color
<br><br>
Response Back - If true, shows the backdrop for the responses<br>
Fill Center - If true, fills the center of the response backdrop's Image. If false, only shows the "outline" of the response backdrop<br>

<br><br>

Step 4: Set your styles.<br><br>

Click the Styles foldout in the Utterer Dialogue System component.<br><br>

Background Style<br>
Background style refers to the background, outline, scrollbar, and advance button. Choose the color and texture (sprite/image) for the enabled<br><br>


Speaker Style<br>
Contains font, font size, font style, font color, font outline, and outline color settings for the speaker font, as well as a spacing setting to control the space between the speaker text and the dialogue text.<br>
This foldout and its contents will be hidden if the Speaker option is disabled<br><br>


Dialogue Style<br>
Contains font, font size, font style, font color, font outline, and outline color settings for the dialogue font<br><br>


Response Style<br>
Contains font, font size, font style, font color, font outline, and outline color settings for the response font. It also includes a Target Image bool to determine which graphic the button should target, a color field for the button background, and a color field for button's highlightColor<br><br>

Utterer Dynamics

<br><br>
Utterer Dynamics is a scriptable object string interpolator which replaces any "call" (a string or part of a string surrounded by < and > ex. <Player>) with its associated "ID" (ex. Madsir). If a call's ID is "color", a color field will appear and you can choose a color and the system will change the string inside the call to your chosen color (ex. Call: <Dynamics>, ID :"color")<br><br>
Calls are interpolated with their IDs/colors/values once when they are enabled in the scene.<br>
Interpolation is handled by the system's Dynamics Assistant, which the Utterer Dynamics asset adds to the current scene<br>

<br><br>
Step 1: Create an Asset<br><br>

In the Project Window, right-click  a folder in Assets, hover over the Create menu, and select Utterer Dynamics.<br>
A new dynamics asset will be created. Rename the asset as you please.<br>
A demo asset can be found here: Assets/Utterer/Demo/Demo Assets/Utterer Dynamics Demo.asset<br><br>

The asset has a Dynamics Assistant setting in its inspector. If Auto is enabled, it will automatically add an Utterer Dynamics Assistant to any opened scene (if one does not exist already). If Auto is disabled, you will have to click the Add Assistant button to add an assistant to the scene. Only one instance of Dynamics Assistant can exist in a scene at a time.<br><br><br>


The Dynamics List
<br><br>
Step 2: Adding Dynamics to Dynamics List
<br><br>
DEVELOPER INPUT<br><br>

Click the 'Add to List' button of the Dynamics List and enter a call key and an ID.<br>
EXAMPLE : In the call field, type in Player In the ID field, type in your name.<br>
Every call begins with < and end with >, but in the Dynamics list < and > are included automatically.<br><br>

Utterer Dynamics can also be used to make specific strings remain a certain color no matter the color of the Text's font.<br><br>

Enter a call key and then in its ID field, type the word 'color' (not case sensitive).<br>
EXAMPLE : In the call field type your name and in the ID field type color<br>
A new color field will appear beneath the ID field. <br>
Choose the color you wish and any instance of the call string will display in that color<br><br>


PLAYER INPUT<br><br>

Add any Input Field to the hierarchy as a child of a Canvas.<br>
Can be Legacy or TextMeshPro<br><br>

1. Add a new element to the Input Field component's On End Edit(), then add the object containing this scene's instance of Utterer Dynamics to the new element's object field.<br><br>

2. Set to On Runtime Only, then call the DynamicsInput(Object) function from UttererDynamics and drag the Input Field object into the DynamicsInput Object field.<br><br>

3. Use the InputField's placeholder text to save the inputted text to a call in the Dynamics List, OR use the placeholder text to create a new call to save to the Dynamics List.<br><br>
EXAMPLE : If the InputField's placeholder text is Player Name Utterer will check the Dynamics list to see if that call exists, and if not, save the call as <Player> so any previously created strings containing <Player> will be replaced with the call's ID.<br>
The ID for the call <Player> is saved as the string inputted by the user during runtime.<br>
Tip: You can make the color of the Placeholder transparent if you don't want it to be shown<br><br><br>


Removing Dynamics<br><br>

Click the Dynamic you want to remove in the Dynamics List, then click the 'Remove from List' button of the Dynamics List.<br>
Utterer will automatically save the Dynamics after you're finished editing the Dynamics List<br><br>


To use a call from the Dynamics List, input it into any component's text area.<br><br>
Example: If the Dynamics List contains the call Player, then type Hello <Player> into the text area and Utterer Dynamics will change the call to the call's ID at runtime<br><br><br><br>











Utterer Porter<br><br>

Import and export data from .csv & .txt files. - Compatible with Utterer Texts, Utterer Dialogue System, and Utterer Caption System.<br><br>


Step 1: Open a Texts, Dialogue, or Captions tool.<br><br>

The Utterer Texts, Utterer Dialogue System, and Utterer Captions System components have an Open button in the inspector to open their respective tools<br><br>


Step 2: Select the 'Porter' button.<br><br>

The tool has a top menu bar, a workspace, and a bottom menu bar. The Porter button (on the right side of the window's bottom menu) opens the tool's Porter window
<br><br>

Step 3: Provide the file path to the target file.<br><br>

Notice the File Path text area is preceded by 'Assets/'. This is because the target file must be located somewhere within your project's Assets folder.<br>
In the File Path field, enter the path to the file you wish to target.<br>
If exporting, the file must be .txt, as Porter cannot export to .csv.<br>
If the file doesn't exist then Porter will create a new .txt file using the File Path.<br>
Example: Utterer/Demo/SavedFiles/Texts-Demo.csv<br><br>


Step 4: Provide the title of the target data within the above file.<br><br>

In the Title path, enter the Title of the data you want to import or export to the target file. The title can be the name of the object, a decriptive word/phrase, etc.<br>
Examples: Greetings Text, Intro Captions, Opening Dialogue, etc<br><br>


Import from file.<br>
Imports the identified text data from the target file into the Utterer component<br><br>

Export to file.<br>
Saves all of the text data from the Utterer component into the target file<br><br>
