	<h1> Radness with a bit of Madness. </h1>
	<h2> Currently developing: Remote Agent </h2>
	<p> Remote Agent is a quirky and colorful 2D platformer about Remy "Rooster" leCoq, whose remote monitoring station has been attacked by an unknown source. 
		Left with no means of communication with Command or his fellow agents, Rooster is forced to make the long journey back to headquarters.<br>
		As his journey begins, it becomes clear that whatever source destroyed Rooster's station has also unleashed swarms of fearsome creatures across the land.
		Will he make it before it's too late or will the world succumb to this strange and new madness?
	</p>
		<h3> Help the remote agent make it back to headquarters!</h3>
