	<h4> Help the remote agent make it back to headquarters!</h4><br>
	<p> Remote Agent is a quirky and colorful 2D platformer about an agent called Rooster whose remote monitoring station has just been attacked by an unknown source. Left with no means of communication with Command or his fellow agents, Rooster is forced to make the long journey back to headquarters. As his journey begins, it becomes apparent that whatever source destroyed Rooster's station has also unleashed swarms of fearsome creatures across the land. With your help, hopefully Rooster can make it back to headquarters and prevent this unknown source of madness from destroying the world.</p>
