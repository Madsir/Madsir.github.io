Madsir Studio presents ...<br>

Remote Agent: Far out in the remote wilderness lives an agent whose aerospace monitoring station has been attacked by an unknown source. Left with no means of communication, he is forced to leave his station and seek help. As his journey begins, however, it becomes clear that whatever source destroyed his monitoring station has also unleashed a strange, new chaos across the land.
