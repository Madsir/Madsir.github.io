<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
	<p>
		1. Add a Cutscheme prefab to your scene (or add a Cutscheme Controller script to an object in your scene).<br><br>

Prefab location: Cutscheme/Prefabs<br>

Script location: Cutscheme/Scripts/CutschemeSystem<br><br>


2. Add the camera you want to control into Cutscheme Controller's 'Main Camera' field.<br><br>

Cutscheme will use this camera for zooming/filters/etc.<br><br>

3. If the above camera needs to be disabled after the cutscene, check the Disposable Camera toggle.<br><br>
	
	The Main Camera for the cutscene will be disabled at the end of the cutscene.<br><br>

4. Add Camera Shots to the Camera Shots array.<br><br>

Cutscheme automatically adds and removes camera transforms to the scene as children of the Cutscheme Controller's game object.<br><br>


5. Manually position and rotate each of the Camera Shots into their places for the cutscene.<br><br>

Cutscheme system follows these positions in index order instead of numerical order, so you can reorder the positions.<br><br>

	</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Camera Shots">
<h2>Camera Shots</h2><br>	<br>
			<p>
				1. Set the duration of the shot before transitioning.<br><br>

This is how long the camera stays still before transitioning. Duration can be zero and the camera will transition immediately. (Useful for consecutive panning shots.)<br><br>


2. Zoom in or out.<br><br>

Setting zoom to true creates fields for the new camera FOV (perspective) and speed of the zoom. Cutscheme will 'zoom' any extra, active cameras in and out by the percent difference between Main Camera's FOV and the camera shot's New FOV.<br><br>


3. Shake the camera.<br><br>

Setting shake to true creates a field for the magnitude at which you want the camera to shake. The higher the power the heavier the shake.
<br><br>

4. Adjust timeScale.<br><br>
Choose a timeScale between 0.1 - 2 to speed up or slow down time during this shot.<br><br>


5. Play an audio clip.<br><br>

This sound will play at the start of the shot. This can be left null.<br><br>


6. Cut instantly or pan/rotate to the next shot.<br><br>

Make sure to set cut instantly or set a pan speed/rotate speed for each shot, else the camera will get stuck.<br><br>

                        <section id="CutschemeAudio">
<h2>Cutscheme Audio
		<br><br>
	Cutscheme creates its own Audio Source at runtime and places it on the Cutscheme's Main Camera.</h2><br>			
	<br><p>
		Cutscheme creates its own Audio Source at runtime and places it on the Cutscheme's Main Camera. This audio source is set up as follows:<br><br>

	Priority: 1<br>
	Stereo Pan: 0<br>
 	Spatial Blend: 1<br>
	Reverb Zone Mix: 1<br>
	Doppler Level: 1<br>
	Rolloff: Custom (Gradual), Max Distance: 500<br><br>

1. Choose whether only cutscene audio should play during the cutscene.<br><br>

If true, Cutscheme pauses the Audio Listener in the scene. All Cutscheme audio and any objects with AudioSources that are enabled, disabled, or moved with Helpful Scripts will ignore the pause on the listener.<br><br>


2. Add an audio clip to the Main Audio field.<br><br>

This audio will play at the start of the cutscene.<br><br>


3. Loop the main audio of the cutscene.<br><br>

This will not loop sounds added to Camera Shots.<br><br>


4. Choose the volume level for the cutscene.<br><br>

This controls the volume level for the main audio and any sounds in Camera Shots.<br><br>

5. Fade the main audio in and/or out at the beginning and end of the cutscene.<br><br>


6. Set the spread angle of Cutscheme audio.

<h2>Cutscheme Options</h2><br>	<br>
<br>
	<br><p>
		1. Fade in and out.<br><br>

Cutscheme creates a black panel at runtime for this purpose and displays it over the camera via a Canvas.<br>

If no Canvas exists in the scene, Cutscheme will create one at runtime. Created canvases and panels for cutscenes are removed from the scene after the cutscene ends.<br><br>


2. Reset camera FOV & position.<br><br>

Cutscheme saves the original size of the controlled camera before the cutscene starts. Reset the camera (or cameras, if multiple) to their original FOV after the cutscene ends.<br><br>


3. Make the cutscene skippable.<br><br>

Whether the cutscene can be skipped by the player. If true, Cutscheme skip the cutscene if any key is pressed after three seconds.<br><br>


4. Ignore time scale.<br><br>

	If true, Cutscheme's timers ignore time scale by using 	unscaledDeltaTime. If false, Cutscheme's timers use the scene's time scale and use deltaTime.<br><br>


5. Change to a new scene.<br><br>

If true, Cutscheme loads new scene via build index after the cutscene ends. If false, cutscheme disables itself after ending.<br><br>

				Hide or show objects/enabled or disable Behaviours during cutscenes.<br><br>

Hidden Until Cutscene<br>

Objects or their Behaviours that are added to Hidden Until Cutscene are disabled before runtime by the Cutscheme Controller Editor, and enabled on cutscene start.<br>

1.	Add a GameObject to this list. That's all you need to do in order to disable this object until the cutscene.<br>
2.	Click "Disable Behaviours" in order to enable the Behaviours list. Cutscheme will automatically add all of that object's Behaviours to this list.<br>
3.	Remove any Behaviours that you do not want Cutscheme to affect. Leave any Behaviours you want to disable/enable.<br><br>

Hidden During Cutscene<br>

Objects or their Behaviours that are added to Hidden During Cutscene are disabled on cutscene start and enabled after the cutscene ends.<br>

1.	Add a GameObject to this list. That's all you need to do in order to disable this object during the cutscene.<br>
2.	Click "Disable Behaviours" in order to enable the Behaviours list. Cutscheme will automatically add all of that object's Behaviours to this list.<br>
3.	Remove any Behaviours that you do not want Cutscheme to affect. Leave any Behaviours you want to disable/enable.<br><br>


Hidden After Cutscene<br>
Objects or their Behaviours that are added to Hidden After Cutscene are disabled after the cutscene ends.<br>

1.	Add a GameObject to this list. That's all you need to do in order to disable this object after the cutscene.<br>
2.	Click "Disable Behaviours" in order to enable the Behaviours list. Cutscheme will automatically add all of that object's Behaviours to this list.<br>
3.	Remove any Behaviours that you do not want Cutscheme to affect. Leave any Behaviours you want to disable/enable.<br><br>
